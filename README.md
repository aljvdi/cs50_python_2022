# CS50 2022 Python Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of CS50 2022 Python course. CS50 is a popular introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. The projects cover various topics and concepts related to Python programming.

## Project Structure

The projects are organised into separate folders for each week of the course. The structure of the folders is as follows:

```sh
├───final_project
├───Week 0
│   ├───einstein
│   ├───faces
│   ├───indoor
│   ├───playback
│   └───tip
├───Week 1
│   ├───bank
│   ├───deep
│   ├───extensions
│   ├───interpreter
│   └───meal
...
```

Each week's folder contains a set of projects or exercises related to the topics covered during that week. For example, Week 0 folder contains projects named `einstein`, `faces`, `indoor`, `playback`, and `tip`.

Additionally, some weeks may include subfolders for specific projects or tests related to the main project. For example, Week 5 folder contains subfolders like `test_bank`, `test_fuel`, `test_plates`, and `test_twttr`, which are test cases for the respective projects.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and utilise the projects in this repository to learn Python programming. Each project folder contains the necessary code files and any additional resources required to understand and complete the project.

To get started, simply navigate to the project folder of your choice and explore the code. You can open the Python files in any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your preference.
